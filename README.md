# SCRIPTS

## GOAL

I put in this repo my scripts. It can be useful like useless.

## Your code is ugly!

1. Fork it
2. Fix it
3. Pull request it

But you can also:

1. harder
2. better
3. faster
4. stronger

More seriously, yes it can be awful and have issues but I want my code to work. I'm not targeting to be the best and to have the perfect code.
